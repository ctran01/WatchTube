        "Season 2 Premieres September 4, 2020 #TheBoysTV\n\n🎵 We Didn’t Start The Fire by Billy Joel https://lnk.to/yiRDCXjwID\n\nAbout Season 2:\nIn a more intense, more desperate Season 2 of THE BOYS, Butcher, Hughie and the team reel from their losses in Season 1. On the run from the law, they struggle to fight back against the Superheroes. As Vought, the company that manages the heroes, cashes in on the panic over the threat of Supervillains, and a new hero, Stormfront, shakes up the company and challenges an already unstable Homelander.\n\nAbout The Boys:\nThe Boys is an irreverent take on what happens when superheroes, who are as popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians and as revered as Gods, abuse their superpowers rather than use them for good. It's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about \"The Seven\", and their formidable Vought backing.\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

        "Halloween Kills - In Theaters October 2021\nhttp://www.halloweenmovie.com/\n\n\nFrom David Gordon Green and John Carpenter:\n\n\nWe write this to you heartbroken over the fact that the delay of our film is even a discussion, but if there’s one thing that a career in the film industry has prepared us for, it is the unexpected. Over the past few weeks, our film family has looked at the forecast of theatrical exhibition with obvious concern. We have discussed and struggled with how best to present “Halloween Kills” to the loyal fans around the world, as well as the new audience we hope to invite to this experience. \n\n\n\nIt was a wild and vibrant production. We lined up a cast of legacy characters like Laurie and Tommy, Lindsey, Lonnie, Marion, Brackett and The Shape, then alongside some new faces, we aggressively made the second chapter of our “Halloween” trilogy. It unfolded into an experience that was a creative playground and we feel confident that our misfit pleasures will be seen as an unexpected entry into this franchise. \n\n\n\nIf we release it in October of this year as planned, we have to face the reality that the film would be consumed in a compromised theatrical experience. After weighing our options, we have chosen to push the film’s theatrical release by one year. \n\n\n\nOn top of a traditional release, Universal has agreed to an IMAX presentation of the film in October 2021. We are sound mixing with one of the greatest design teams that can slash, scream and creep their way under your skin. We’re going to have time to complete the film with the quality that fans deserve. And preparation on “Halloween Ends” has begun as well. \n\n\n\nIt is an honor to be working with these characters and spending time in Haddonfield. We look forward to sharing our next chapters with you. \n\n\n\nDavid Gordon Green and John Carpenter",
